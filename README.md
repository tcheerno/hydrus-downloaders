Get numerical tag id you want to download by going to minitokyo, search for the thing you need, then go to any category and check URL for tid parameter.

Why?

Minitokyo has 3 different post categories:
- wallpapers - usually made from other works with some filters, scaled/cropped to common resolutions
- indy art - unsorted fanworks
- scans - the meat of minitokyo, high-resolution scans of official and unofficial albums.

The way these are accessed is: You search for a tag, and choose which category to browse. And while doing so, you might notice that your tag disappears from the URL and turns into a tag id. tid=1262, for example. Since human-readable tags are only used to look up tag description, actual search is performed with tag ids, and there is no obvious table for simple conversion of a tag to its corresponding id.
